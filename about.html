Apart from designing, I love shopping, Starbucks and the animals. Yes I know, basic. Currently finishing my last year of graphic design at <em>Algonquin College</em>. Super excited to be done and get out there and start designing. Keyboard shortcuts, learning new styles, and good type are life. I'd love to help out with a project, so get in touch if you think we could create something together, feel free to send me an email at <strong>hey@saracase.ca</strong></p>
