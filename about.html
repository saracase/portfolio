                <p itemprop="about" class="gutter brand-family">I am a graphic designer, currently living in <em>Ottawa, Canada</em>, with a passion for illustration, typography and progressive enhancement. Apart from designing, I love shopping, Starbucks and the animals. Yes I know, basic. Currently finishing my last year of graphic design at <em>Algonquin College</em>. Super excited to be done and get out there and start designing.</p>
                <p class="gutter brand-family">Keyboard shortcuts, learning new styles, and good type are life. I'd love to help out with a project, so get in touch if you think we could create something together, feel free to send me an email at <strong>hey@saracase.ca</strong></p>
