            <p class="gutter brand-family">NorthBound is an upcomign leatherback notebook company. I designed the logo for it which included designing a new typeface. The owner wanted a simple and clean look to it, so I added no decorations to it. The colour chosen is just black, I went with that because it gave it a more clean look.</p>
