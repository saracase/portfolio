            <p class="gutter brand-family">NorthBound is an upcomign leatherback notebook company. I designed the logo for it which included designing a new typeface. The owner wanted a simple and clean look to it, so I added no decorations to it. The colour chosen is just black, I went with that because it gave it a more clean look.</p>

            <h1 class="peta gutter">The Door Logo Design</h1>
            <p class="gutter brand-family">The Door is an upcoming home brewed beer company. I design two logos for the company. The first one is a glass of beer with the door in the middle, and the second one was more of a wordmark design. The client wanted a light and clean feel to the logos. The colours chosen were based on actual colours of beer and also the clients colours.</p>

            <p class="gutter brand-family">McVities is a British cookie company. For a class assignment, we had to re-do a package so I choose McVities. I chose them because I love their cookies and their package seemed boring, I wanted to add more typical British lifestyle graphics to it. The colours I chose were very basic, non-vibrant colours, I did that because I wanted to make it feel more natural.</p>

            <p class="gutter brand-family">Tiffany's is a jewellery store specializing in engagement rings. For a class assignment, we had to create ads that would go with the company. I decided to choose Tiffany's. The theme of my ads was that love is all around the world. I decided to show this by having a couple getting engaged all around the world, more specifically in top cities known for romance. The colours I choose where mostly Tiffany blues and some pastel colours to make the ads feel light and airy.</p>
