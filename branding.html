                <p itemprop="about" class="paragraph gutter brand-family">The Door is an upcoming home brewed beer company. I design two logos for the company. The first one is a glass of beer with the door in the middle, and the second one was more of a wordmark design. The client wanted a light and clean feel to the logos. The colours chosen were based on actual colours of beer and also the clients colours.</p>

                <p itemprop="about" class="paragraph gutter brand-family">McVities is a British cookie company. I redid the packaging to make it look more British. I chose them because I love their cookies and their package seemed boring, I wanted to add more typical British lifestyle graphics to it. The colours I chose were very basic, non-vibrant colours, I did that because I wanted to make it feel more natural.</p>

                <p itemprop="about" class="paragraph gutter brand-family">Tiffany's is a jewellery store specializing in engagement rings. The theme of my ads was that love is all around the world. I decided to show this by having a couple getting engaged all around the world, more specifically in top cities known for romance. The colours I choose where mostly Tiffany blues and some pastel colours to make the ads feel light and airy.</p>
